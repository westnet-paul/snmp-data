# snmp-data
Model definitions shared between SNMP service and client

Abstracting the SNMP `Host` model from the SNMP service allows the model to be shared with the client without introducing possible errors through code redundancy.

`pip install` this package directly from github (it's a public repository for that reason). Best practice is to tag a specific version and install it explicitly.
